When Microsoft released [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/), I immediately switched to it because it was *blazingly fast*.

However, it was missing *something*. **Extensions**.

Finally Microsoft released the [Marketplace](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/).

Since then, I am always researching for the best extensions, but often they're hidden by the oldest ones. So if you have something to suggest, please comment down, and I will add it on this list!

In the meanwhile, I suggest these amazing extensions that I use everyday!

# Programming

1. ### expand-region

    The original expand-shrink region feature of vs-code does not work very well, [this extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=letrieu.expand-region), works very well and it's really similar to the Resharper Expand-Shrink region feature with *ctrl+w* and *shift+ctrl+w*

2. ### Code Ace Jumper

    I wasn't able to find an 'ace-jump' extension on vscode, so I had to write it myself. 
    [This extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=lucax88x.codeacejumper) tries to emulate the famous 'ace-jump' extension available on Emacs. 
    Trust me, once you try it you will never come back.

# Snippets

1. ### Angular 1 JavaScript and TypeScript Snippets 
    ![](https://github.com/johnpapa/vscode-angular1-snippets/raw/master/images/use-extension.gif)

    [This extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=johnpapa.Angular1) generate snippets that follow the [John Papa's Angular 1 styleguide](https://github.com/johnpapa/angular-styleguide/blob/master/a1/README.md), in fact the author of the extension is John Papa itself.
     
2. ### Angular 2 JavaScript and TypeScript Snippets

    [This extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=johnpapa.Angular2) is the same as the last one, but for Angular 2.


# Linters

    Mac: *opt+cmd+up* or *opt+cmd+down*

    Windows: *ctrl+alt+up* or *ctrl+alt+down*
