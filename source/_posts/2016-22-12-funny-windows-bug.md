One day, I was working on a folder, and suddenly my git was blaming me because there were  untracked files on a unknown folder I didn't create.

I went on the file system, I found that folder, and then I deleted the content of this folder. 

*I obviously used SHIFT+DEL, and I didn't commit.*

Great, I then went back to the correct folder in order to resume my work. **It was empty. NADA. VOID.**

Ok, after wasting a day for understanding what happend, I finally understood.

Enjoy!
